In the past I have always taken heavy notes in my harder college courses (think
things like Algorithms, Cal III, Operating Systems, etc) and have always felt
like I would prefer to do so on the computer. Mostly because I want to know that
if I am going to take the time to write them I want to know I'll have them
forever. I have lost so many notebooks full of knowledge from courses I have
taken that I may have put up somewhere that I'll never find it, or possibly lost
completely. I have always used Word, or more recently Google Docs in order to
take notes. However, the ones I do have saved I find wishing that they were in
a format better suited to sharing online with others.

When I would write my notes in Word, semseters past, I would think about doing
them in HTML. HTML would allow me to do formatting on par with Word, but there
is no way I could keep up writing notes in class if I was worried about the
formatting markup as well. I could always add it in after I took my notes, but
I know I would never get around to doing it.

Over the past year I have started using Markdown heavily and am absolutely in
love with it. I try to do everything in Markdown. I am writing this post in
Markdown. So the other day I thought about using it to write notes and how much
formatting HTML I would get for free. Using a text editor that understands
markdown will allow me to do it even easier. Not only that, but after a quick
`git init` I'll get easy version control. Being in Markdown, I can push them
up to GitHub and they'll take care of rendering the stuff to HTML to share with
others. I also know it'll make my notes more safe, putting GitHub's data center
redundancy to work. I feel like I'll be able to take notes more quickly in a
light Markdown editor than I would in Word or Google Docs.

This is my last semester coming up in the Fall so I will be trying this out
then. I just wish I had all of my notes from all the courses I've taken as
browseable and rendered Markdown on GitHub. Another benefit for anyone that
decided to do this as they were going into computer science or software
engineering is that they would be able to show employers all the work they did
and everything they learned first hand. I really wish I could do that. I don't
think I can send in seven beat up old notebooks full of handwritten notes in
with my resume.
