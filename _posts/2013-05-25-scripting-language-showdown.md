My first experience with a scripting language I suppose was technically Python,
however, due to my experience with imperative languages such as C/C++/Java,
I had basically used Python the same way. My true first scripting language
was actually JavaScript, and mostly this is a recent thing. However, I
absolutely love using both JavaScript and Python both when I get the chance. I
have begun to form some thoughts about these two in comparison to each other
and wanted to create a post that organized these thoughts and possibly garner
some from others as well.

JavaScript was originally the browser's little scripting language to allow
minor dynmaic behavior within HTML documents. It has exploded since then if
you haven't noticed. JavaScript is being used everywhere I look now days. GNOME
uses JavaScript for most of their user interface. In order to change the
behavior and look/transparency of the system tray in GNOME 3 which I found
annoying be [simply editing some JavaScript files and a CSS entry][1]!
