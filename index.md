My name is Cory Gross. I am a software developer graduating with my Bachelor's
in Software Engineering from Auburn University in December of 2013. I am
interested in working with a like-minded team to build good software that
people actually use. I am also interested in things like: open source
technologies, standards, and platforms such as the Web, mobile platforms, game
development, and technology in general. I am the type that is interested in
technology for it's own sake, but I also want to make an impact with my work.
I love learning to use new tools and technology and I have a passion for open
source.
 
I enjoy the startup atmosphere and could definitely see myself working in the
Silicon Valley area with a small team. However, I also think it would also be
amazing to work at some of the larger tech companies that I have admired.
Another passion of mine is games and I would love to develop them for a living
if I landed a job with the right studio.

You can contact me anytime with questions about my experience or with
information about a job. If you're a developer and have questions about any of
my articles or projects please do not hesitate to contact me as well. I enjoy
solving technical problems and love people being able to learn from things
I've done in the past.

Here are my profiles on my favorite spots to hang out on the Web:
