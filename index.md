My name is Cory Gross. I am a software developer graduating in December 2013
with my Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering from Auburn University. I am
interested in working with a like-minded team to build good software that
people actually use. I am also interested in things like: open platforms such as
the Web, mobile applications, networking, graphics, physics, game development,
and technology in general. I am the type that is interested in technology and
its advancement for it's own sake, but I'd also like to make a real impact with
my work. I feel the desire for my software to be used. I love learning to use
new tools and technology, and I also have a passion for open source.
 
I enjoy the startup atmosphere and could definitely see myself heading out to
the Silicon Valley area after graduation. However, there are also larger tech
companies that I have always admired and I think it would be amazing to work at
any one of those places as well. Another passion of mine is games. There are
lots of game studios and figures in the gaming industry that I've looked up to
as well.

This site will serve as a personal blog for my experiences and place to post
technical articles. It will also house a growing body of my work that I am
making available online now that I have started to learn HTML5 and JavaScript
and other web technologies in the past year. Previously, my experience was
mostly in more traditional native languages such as (C, C++, Java, etc). I
have since expanded my horizons to include modern web devlopment, both backend
and frontend. I like writing client server systems and have done so in
C, C++, Java, and JavaScript using Node.JS. This blog was created using a static
site generator called [**Jekyll**][1] written in Ruby.

Feel free to contact me anytime about employment or with questions about my
experience. If you're a developer and have questions about any of my articles
or projects please do not hesitate to contact me as well. I enjoy working on
problems and like collaborating with others online. Just drop me a line.
